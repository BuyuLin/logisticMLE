This repository contains raw code to reproduce results from the paper "The Asymptotic Distribution of the MLE in High-dimensional Logistic Models: Arbitrary Covariance".

Each directory corresponds to code and output in one section. All the files are organized as follows:
- **code** : R code to generate parameters, simulate data, estimate parameters and fit logistic regressions
- **param**: raw parameters 
- **output**: raw output. Sometimes the outputs are splitted to conform to size restriction
- **results**: R code to analyze results and produce table/figure.

A r package that streamlines procedures described in the paper to adjust high-dimensional logistic MLE is still under construction. In the meantime, if you are interested in the phenomenon, *to add* provides a quick demonstration. You can also look at the example data analysis in *real* folder.
